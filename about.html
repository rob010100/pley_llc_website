    <br>
    <p>We don't aim to just collab on projects, collect a paycheck and then call it a day. We want to dream together and make a positive impact in our world.</p>

              <h3>We believe big things often have humble beginnings.</h3>
              <p>Rob, our founder, got his technological start on a Tandy 1000 in the 1980s. That early fascination with technology never faded, but rather evolved into a lifelong passion for solving problems through technology.</p>
              <br>
              <p>After earning a specialized degree in Information Systems and spending decades in operational management, and now that his own kids are off to college, he decided it was time for something new. Bringing a lifetime of leadership experience and altruistic passions, he returned to his first love: technology.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Now based in Kansas City, MO, <strong>Rob founded <span class="pley-green">PLEY</span> in 2024 to serve the small businesses and nonprofits within our community</strong>-people and organizations that deserve thoughtful, affordable, and dependable tech support.</p>

              <h3>Optimizing Technological Solutions</h3>
              <p>Whether it's building websites from the ground up, managing digital systems, or offering practical consulting, our focus is on building real connections and lasting partnerships.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
              <p>Our name, <span class="pley-green">PLEY</span>, was born out of a challenge from a creative solutions workshop: create a four-letter acronym that could inspire in as many ways as possible.</p>
              <br>
              <p>That spirit of creativity and purpose still guides our mission today. As a family based business, we are committed to personalized service and helping our neighbors.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We're also driven by inclusion. Rob’s brother-in-law, who lives with an intellectual disability, has faced ongoing barriers to employment. His experience inspires <span class="pley-green">PLEY's</span> commitment to a hiring model that supports individuals with disabilities.</p>
